## About
Embarking on my first data science project, this repository documents my progression as I explore SQL-based data analysis using PostgreSQL, with a specific focus on understanding the complexities of Covid-19 data. While I'm on a mission to learn, I'm excited to share this journey openly, creating a resource for anyone eager to learn alongside me.

## Observations & Findings
