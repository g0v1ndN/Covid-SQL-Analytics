# Covid-SQL-Analytics

## About
Embarking on my first data science project by closely following Alex The Analyst's methodical <a href="https://youtu.be/qfyynHBFOsM">YouTube tutorial</a>.  This repository documents my progression as I explore SQL-based data analysis, with a specific focus on Covid-19 complexities. While I'm on a mission to learn, I'm excited to share this journey openly, creating a resource for anyone eager to learn alongside me.

<b>Note:</b> This project is currently a work in progress and may not be fully functional or complete. It is being actively developed to add additional features and improve existing functionality.
