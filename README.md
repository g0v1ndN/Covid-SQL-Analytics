## About
Embarking on my first data science project, I am referring to Alex The Analyst's methodical <a href="https://youtu.be/qfyynHBFOsM">YouTube tutorial</a> as a guide. This repository documents my progression as I explore SQL-based data analysis, with a specific focus on understanding the complexities of Covid-19 data. While I'm on a mission to learn, I'm excited to share this journey openly, creating a resource for anyone eager to learn alongside me.

<b>Note:</b> This project is currently a work in progress and may not be fully functional or complete. It is being actively developed to add additional features and improve existing functionality.
